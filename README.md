Introduction:
This Pig Game is a simple dice rolling game where two players take turns rolling a dice to accumulate points. The game was developed by Owais Ahmad.

Objective:
The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach a predefined winning score (usually 100 points) by rolling the dice and strategically choosing when to hold and when to roll again.

Rules:

    The game is played by two players taking turns.
    On each turn, a player can roll the dice as many times as they wish. The sum of the rolled values will be added to their current score.
    If a player rolls a 1 on the dice, their current score is lost, and it becomes the next player's turn.
    Players have the option to "Hold" their current score at any point during their turn. When they choose to hold, their current score is added to their total score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

    If you roll a 1 on the dice, your current score will be reset, and it becomes the next player's turn.
    To keep your current score and add it to your total score, click the "Hold" button.
    The first player to reach the winning score is declared the winner.
